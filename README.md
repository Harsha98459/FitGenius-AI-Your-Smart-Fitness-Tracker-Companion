### **How to Run the Application**

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install Python (3.7 or higher).
   - Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn
     ```
   - Ensure you have the following files in the same directory as `app.py`:
     - `calories.csv` (dataset for calories burned).
     - `exercise.csv` (dataset for exercise data).
     - Background images (e.g., `login img.jpeg`, `after login img.jpg`).

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `app.py`.
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
   - The app will start, and a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`) will open in your browser.

3. **Using the App**:
   - **Register**: Create a new account by providing a username and password.
   - **Login**: Use your credentials to log in.
   - **Input Parameters**: Enter your fitness details (age, BMI, exercise duration, etc.) in the sidebar.
   - **Predict Calories**: View the predicted calories burned and personalized recommendations.
